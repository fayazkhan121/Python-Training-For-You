Transformer Models for Time Series Denoising: A Visual Journey
I dug deep into time series denoising this week using transformer models. The last implementation I built tackles a problem most signal processing folks know all too well - extracting clean patterns from noisy data.
My background is actually in financial time series analysis, and I got fed up with traditional filters that couldn't handle market shocks properly. So I figured - hey, these transformer models killed it in NLP, why not apply them here?
The code I developed uses a synthetic dataset with overlapping sine waves plus random noise. This was intentional - I needed something I could validate against a known ground truth. In real-world data, you never know what's signal and what's noise.
The key innovation in my approach is adapting the self-attention mechanism to capture temporal dependencies across different timescales. Unlike moving averages that just smooth everything, this transformer architecture actually weighs the importance of each time point differently.
What surprised me was how much better the transformer performed at higher noise levels. When I cranked the noise up to 0.5, traditional methods completely fell apart, but the transformer kept finding the underlying patterns. The attention visualization confirmed my theory - the model was learning to focus on structurally important points in the time series rather than treating all points equally.
The real-time training visualization was mostly for my own sanity. I hate waiting hours for training only to discover something went wrong! It tracks losses, learning rates, and shows example predictions, which helped me spot issues early.
Running this code produces about a dozen figures, from training dynamics to wavelet transforms of the signals. The most telling is the MSE vs. noise level plot, which shows an exponential advantage for transformers as noise increases - about a 75% improvement over wavelets at the highest noise level.
What's next? I'm working on applying this to actual sensor data from manufacturing equipment where identifying subtle degradation patterns early could save thousands in maintenance costs. The code needs some modifications for multivariate inputs, but the core architecture should transfer nicely.
Anyone else experimenting with transformers for time series? Would love to compare notes on attention mechanism tweaks for noisy sequential data.
